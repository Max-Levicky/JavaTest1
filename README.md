Test for JavaDevelopers (Level 1)
=================================

Please, take a look to interface com.getintent.interview.MonochromeScreen and it's 
documentation. You should:

  * Clone repository
  * Implement the interface partially: only init() and drawHorizontalLine() methods should be implemented. All others would throw UnsupportedOperationException
  * Please, use as least memory as possible. The key problem here is finding efficient memory structure
  * Also please implement unit test for you implementation (use any library you like)
  * Ideally, you make a fork and pull request on GitHub. Archiving you local repository and sending to us also works.
