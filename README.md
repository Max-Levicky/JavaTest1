Test for JavaDevelopers
=======================


### Task 1 (monochrome screen)

Please, take a look to interface com.getintent.interview.MonochromeScreen and it's 
documentation. Implement *only* init() and drawHorizontalLine() methods according to their signature.
Let other methods throw UnsupportedOperationException.

Please, note that key problem here is finding efficient memory structure for storing screen state

### Task 2 (tree printing)

Please, take a look to interface com.getintent.interview.TreeWriter interface. Implement it
according to documentation.

### Task 2.1* (extra credit)

The same as Task 2, but also implement the code that restores (parses) the tree back from it's written form.

# Submitting tasks

When implementing and submitting tasks you should:

  * Clone repository
  * Implement the task
  * Write a unit tests that checks that your implementation is correct
  * Ideally you make a fork and pull request on GitHub. Archiving you local repository and sending to us also works.

# Questions?
